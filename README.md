### Project Description
Tired of regular coins being either heads or tails? Introducing the **Quantum Coin Flipper** ‚Äî a coin that defies classical physics! Flip it to reveal not just heads or tails, but maybe both... or something more *explosive*.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Traditional coin flips are boring, predictable, and limited to two outcomes. In a world embracing quantum weirdness, why settle for binary?


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We‚Äôve digitized the uncertainty principle! With just one click, our coin might show heads, tails, both at once, or even explode in a parallel universe. Because why not?
